Success! Although, I did not try to attempt the bonus because of time restrictions.

Ensure that you are able to print out the following format specifiers:
```
- %c (char)
- %s (char *)
- %i (int)
- %d (base 10)
- %u (unsigned int)
- %x (hexadecimal of %u in lowercase)
- %X (hexadecimal of %u in uppercase)
- %% (percent sign '%')
```
